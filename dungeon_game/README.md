##Learning Python - Dungeon Game

####Goals
- Write a small command line application in python.
- Familiarise myself with python syntax.
- Reinforce basic control flow concepts.
- Do some ascii art (loose)

The aim of the game is to escape the dungeon. To do so, the player must first avoid the monster, find the sword then slay the monster and collect the key he wears round his neck. The door will then open and the player can escape.


The game is made without the use of classes, though these would be better style. The long sequences of if statements could use a refactor, perhaps to a switch case type affair. Perhaps the biggest difficulty was the monster check function.

Made using a combination of pylint and pylama.

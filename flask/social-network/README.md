#Building a simple social network with python and Flask.

##Goals
To get comfortable with the Flask framework and test it against Django/DRF for an upcoming large scale web app that needs to make use of numpy, scipy and machine learning libraries.

This project draws heavily on the 'Build a social network with Flask' tutorial from Treehouse.

##Stack
Flask. The primary web server and framework for the project, Flask has great documentation and an active community. It also feels familiar (Express-like).

PeeWee, a great python ORM.

Postgres for the database.

flask-login. Provides session management and handles logging in and out. Provides the UserMixin parent class, which adds several attributes and a method.
